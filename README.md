### Project Title: Foodiology

### Group Members
Katie Shao and Carol Zhou

### Description
Foodiology is a website that generates easy-to-make recipes for our users based on their input ingredients. Say goodbye to food waste and hello to easy and delicious meals!

### Objective
Our website aims to create a food recipe platform where the users can input the ingrediants they have in their cabinet and generate recipes.

### Challenges
The log in page's layout was not aligned to the center. We fixed it by specifying the text align to center.

### Contribution
Katie worked on the createaccount.html and login.html. Carol worked on the 
basics.html and style.css.
